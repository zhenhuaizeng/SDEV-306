        <p>
          <strong>I was born in Sichuan, China.</strong> I came to the United States when I was 18. When I
          came here, I lived
          in <strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong>. I moved to <strong>Washington State</strong> when I was 21. I
          moved to <strong>WA state</strong> From PA
          state because my mother and her family are here. My mother and her family have lived in WA state for more
          than
          Ten years. They thought it would be too hard for me to live in Pittsburgh by myself, so they told me to move
          to WA states. That is why I did so. After I moved here, I started going to school. <em>GreenRiver
          college</em> is my first
          Collge in <strong>WA State</strong>. After I had spent two years in <em>GreenRiver College</em>, I
          transferred to the <em>University of Washington</em>
          Seattle campus. At first, It was fun to study at the <strong>University of Washington</strong>. However, I
          found out that
          it was hard to learn because there was too much homework, and my grades needed to improve to get
          into the computer science program. So, I chose to go back to <strong>GreenRiver College</strong> to study
          <strong>software development</strong>.
